# Multiplication

Write methods/functions that calculates the product of two numbers without the use of the multiplication operator *
_For languages without a primitive unbounded integer type, It's sufficient to use an upper bound equal to the maximum value of a 32-bit integer or 32-bit floating point number_

Case 1
- The product of two natural numbers [0, 1, 2, . . âˆž)

Case 2
- The product of two integers (-âˆž, . . , -1, 0, 1, . . +âˆž)

Case 3
- The product of two real numbers (-âˆž, . . , 1.234, . . +âˆž)
